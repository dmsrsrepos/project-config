<h1>File Nesting Config<sup><em> for VS Code</em></sup></h1>

> Requires VS Code v1.67

This is a config snippet making your file tree cleaner with the [file nesting feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67#_explorer-project-config) of VS Code.

Inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dzhavatushev/status/1500511236634599430) by [Dzhavat Ushev](https://twitter.com/dzhavatushev) and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jachands/status/1500173829733240844) by [Jacob Hands](https://twitter.com/jachands).

With some scripts to avoid duplication of works. And it's very opinionated.

## Use it
